  "summary": "You specify the dependencies for your project in a simple text file: your Podfile.",
  "description": "CocoaPods aims to improve the engagement with, and discoverability of, third party open-source Cocoa libraries. These project goals influence and drive the design of CocoaPods:\n\nCreate and share libraries, and use them in your own projects, without creating extra work for library authors. Integrate non-CocoaPods libraries and hack on your own fork of any CocoaPods library with a simple transparent Podspec standard.\nAllow library authors to structure their libraries however they like.\nSave time for library authors by automating a lot of Xcode work not related to their libraries' functionality.\nSupport any source management system. (Currently supported are git, svn, mercurial, bazaar, and various types of archives downloaded over HTTP.)\nPromote a culture of distributed collaboration on pods, but also provide features only possible with a centralised solution to foster a community.\nBuild tools on top of the core Cocoa development system, including those typically deployed to other operating systems, such as web-services.\nProvide opinionated and automated integration, but make it completely optional. You may manually integrate your CocoaPods dependencies into your Xcode project as you see fit, with or without a workspace.\nSolve everyday problems for Cocoa and Xcode developers.",
