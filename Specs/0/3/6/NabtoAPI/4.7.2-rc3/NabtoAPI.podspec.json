  "description": "This pod installs the iOS version of the cross-platform ANSI C based Nabto Client API library. You should probably use the Nabto Client pod instead as it provides a higher level Objective C wrapper. Any suggestions on how to cleanly combine source files (the Objective C wrapper) with an external dependency (not in github - the large Nabto library files are deployed on CDN) are appreciated :-).\n\nThe Nabto communication platform enables you to establish direct connections from a client to even the most resource constrained devices, regardless of the firewall configuration of each peer - a P2P middleware that supports IoT well.\n\nThe platform has been designed from the ground and up with strong security as a focal point. All in all, it enables vendors to create simple, high performant and secure solutions for their Internet connected products with very little effort.",
